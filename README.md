Handwritten Digit Recognition Project
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits from images. It uses a dataset of handwritten digits (commonly the MNIST dataset) to train a model that can accurately classify new, unseen digits. The project leverages Python and popular libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, or Scikit-learn to implement the recognition system.

1. Introduction
Handwritten digit recognition is a common problem in the field of computer vision and machine learning. The goal of this project is to design a model that can identify and classify digits written by humans. This problem is often tackled using neural networks, especially deep learning models.

2. Dataset
The primary dataset used in this project is the MNIST dataset (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology). This dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0 to 9). Each image is a 28x28 grayscale image of a digit.

Training Set: 60,000 labeled images
Test Set: 10,000 labeled images
Input format: 28x28 pixel grayscale images of digits
Output format: 10 possible classes (digits 0-9)
